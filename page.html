        <li><strong>1931</strong> - Studies at King's College, Cambridge for 3 years</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> - Publishes his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" in which he introduces Turing Machines which later contributed to the Church-Turing thesis</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> - Starts to study under Alonzo Church at Princton University for 2 years</li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Obtains his PhD from Department of Mathematics at Princton</li>
        <li><strong>1940</strong> - Installed the first bombe (An electromechanical machine used to break Enigma) with the help of his colleges</li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Starts to work part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School to work on deciphering the Enigma machine</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Moves to Hut 8 to investigate on the German naval Enigma</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Proposes marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, which later discontinued due to Turing being Homosexual</li>

        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Works on the design of ACE, the first detailed design of a stored-program  computer</li>
        <li><strong>1949</strong> - Designs one of the earliest stored-program computers called Manchester Mark 1</li>
        <li><strong>1950</strong> - Proposes the idea of Turing test, an important contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence</li>
