      <li><strong>1938</strong> - Starts to work part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School to work on deciphering the Enigma machine</li>
      <li><strong>1941</strong> - Moves to Hut 8 to investigate on the German naval Enigma</li>
      <li><strong>1941</strong> - Proposes marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, which later discontinued due to Turing being Homosexual</li>
